fvSolution is used for:
- outer correctors specification
- control tight coupling for iterating energy, fuel temp, thermal-mechanics and neutronics
- time step residual, the degree of convergence for multi-physics iterations
- maximum time step iterations, which is the maximum iterations for multi-physics

fvSchemes is a dummy file, so that pre-processing activities can proceed.
